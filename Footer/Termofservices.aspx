                If an Employer accepts a Contractor&#39;s bid for a Contract, a services contract is 
                formed directly between such Employer and Contractor subject to the terms 
                specified in Section 3 (Service Contract Terms Between Employer and Contractor) 
                and/or any other terms and conditions that Employer and Contractor may agree 
                upon through the Work4Sale Platform (&quot;Service Contract&quot;). Work4Sale is not a party to 
                any Service Contract between Employers and Contractors and Work4Sale itself does not 
                deliver any Contracts or Work Product, nor does Work4Sale make any representations 
                regarding the quality thereof, except as may be otherwise explicitly set forth 
                by Work4Sale. Any agreement or attempted agreement between Employer and Contractor, 
                in connection with a Service Contract, requiring that payment be made outside of 
                the Work4Sale Platform shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement and be

                using our systems and resources. Work4Sale is not a service company and does not 
                manage individual Services or individual Contractors or their work, in any 
                manner. Work4Sale expects a consistent and high level of courtesy, respect and 
                professionalism from all of its Users toward each other and reserves the right 
                to expel any User from our network at any time. Users agree to use good judgment 
                when posting information, comments, feedback or other content regarding other 
                Users, Work4Sale or any other third party anywhere within the Work4Sale Platform. Users 
                may be held legally responsible for damages suffered by other Users, Work4Sale or 
                any third party as a result of legally actionable or defamatory comments, 
                remarks or other information or content posted to the Work4Sale Platform. All 
                Employers and Contractors are to comply with any policies which are incorporated 
                into this Agreement by reference. These policies may be modified from time to 
                time at Work4Sale&#39;s discretion and the current effective policy will be deemed to be 
                part of this Agreement.</div>

                or other content posted or made available on the Work4Sale Platform by any User or

                legally actionable. Work4Sale is not responsible for and does not monitor or censor 
                content for accuracy or reliability. However, Work4Sale reserves the right to remove 
                or restrict access to any information or content posted or made available on the

                        Diary via 1) Work4Sale Team, or 2) entering offline time, will not be paid. Time 
                        logged for a Contract must be directly related to the completion of that 
                        Contract. If the Contractor bills offline time, those hours are subject to 
                        dispute by the Employer and not guaranteed by Work4Sale. The Contractor is 
                        responsible for providing all tools and resources necessary to complete the 
                        Contract, unless explicitly stated in advance by the Employer. Contractors agree 
                        to respond to all Employer communications and requests for information within 
                        one business day. If the Contractor will be unable to meet this requirement due 
                        to an absence, he is expected to notify the Employer at least 2 weeks prior. 
                        After the completion of a Contract, the Contractor agrees to provide timely,

                payments to Work4Sale and to make and accept payments from other Users in the 
                purchase and sale of Services through the Work4Sale Platform. Each Contractor must 
                properly discharge and credit its Employer for all payments Work4Sale receives 
                through the Payment Service from such Employers. Amounts transferred or stored 
                in the Payment Service are not insured deposits. Solely for purposes of the 
                Payment Service and not for any other Services available through the Work4Sale 
                Platform, Work4Sale acts as your agent and not as a trustee or fiduciary with 
                respect to such funds or payments. However, you understand and agree that Work4Sale 
                will not hold funds delivered as payments to Work4Sale from Users in a separate 
                account, but may commingle and deposit such funds with other funds to be paid to 
                other Users and with funds of Work4Sale. In addition, you understand that such 
                commingled funds could be used to pay other Users and by Work4Sale for general 
                corporate purposes or otherwise, provided that Work4Sale will remain contractually 
                obligated to make payment to you, as a Contractor, for any purchases and sales 
                of Services provided by you through the Work4Sale Platform. Except pursuant to the 
                Hold On Funds Policy below, to the extent Work4Sale is obligated to make payment to 
                you as a Service Contractor, you will be an unsecured creditor of Work4Sale.</div>

                Employer’s credit card, initiating an improper chargeback, or any other means, 
                Employer’s Work4Sale account will be suspended, no additional payments will be

                available remedies, Employer must reimburse Work4Sale for amounts due upon demand, 
                plus any applicable processing fees, charges or penalties, plus interest at the

                law, plus attorneys’ fees and other costs of collection as allowed by law. In

                or held for Employer, make appropriate reports to credit reporting agencies and

                subject to charge back or if fraud is suspected. Work4Sale will release a hold as

                Agreement, the Work4Sale payment guarantee shall be revoked and all monies in the 
                account may be held and/or reclaimed, not just those from the Contract(s) under

                For Hourly-Rate Contracts only, Employers may dispute hours during the 4 days 
                following the close of a weekly invoice period. It is the Employer&#39;s 
                responsibility to review the Work Diary and Time Log of every Contract on a 
                weekly basis and filing any disputes on a timely basis. Once the dispute period 
                has passed, the charges are accepted by the Employer and can no longer be 
                disputed and can only be refunded by the Contractor. Disputes can only address 
                the hours billed, not the quality of the work performed or deliverables.</div>

                Agencies and Agency Contractors.</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
                An Agency is an organization seeking to make money on Work4Sale by selling the 
                Services of Agency Contractors. An Agency Contractor is a Contractor under 
                contract to do work on Work4Sale on behalf of an Agency. An Agency has a manager 
                responsible for the actions of all its members, including its Agency 
                Contractors, administrators in charge of maintaining the company&#39;s finances, 
                roster, and profile, and staffing managers in charge of finding and supervising 
                Contracts. One User may serve in all or multiple roles. Every person who will do 
                work for an Agency must have an individual user account and Contractor profile. 
                These profiles must be associated with your Agency on Work4Sale. Agencies must 
                comply with Section 2.3 (&quot;Identity&quot;) above. If an Agency Contractor is no longer 
                working for your Agency, you may not use the Contractor&#39;s profile in any way. 
                Contractors leaving an Agency must contact the Agency manager to remove their 
                association. Agencies may not refuse to release an Agency Contractor. When 
                leaving the Agency, Agency Contractors keep their profiles, including their work 
                and feedback histories. Their histories are meant to reflect work done by them. 
                The Agency&#39;s work and feedback history will retain the Contracts of Contractors 
                who have since left the company. Former Agency Contractors must comply with 
                non-compete agreements signed outside of the Work4Sale system, but only if such 
                agreements are valid where Contractors reside. (In California, for 
                example,&nbsp;non-compete agreement&nbsp;generally are not valid under California Business 
                &amp; Professions Code § 16600.)&nbsp;Accordingly, Section 13.11 (Choice of Law) 
                notwithstanding,&nbsp;non-compete agreements shall be governed by and construed in 
                accordance with the laws of the local jurisdiction where the Contractor resides. 
                If a Contractor violates an Agency&#39;s valid non-compete agreement, Work4Sale retains 
                the right to suspend the Contractor until the parties reach a mutually agreeable 
                resolution. An Agency that requests the immediate suspension of a Contractor 
                must provide the documents and supporting legal authority that prove, to Work4Sale&#39;s 
                satisfaction, that the non-compete agreement is valid.&nbsp;</div>

                Work4Sale has the right, but not the obligation, to suspend or cancel your account 
                if it believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or 
                spirit of this Agreement or violated our rights or those of another party. 
                Without limiting Work4Sale&#39;s other remedies, we may suspend or terminate your 
                account, reclaim any available funds and refuse to provide any further access to 
                the Work4Sale Platform to you if (a) you breach any terms and conditions of this 
                Agreement or other written policies and procedures posted on the Site; (b) we 
                are unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide to us; or (c) 
                we believe that your actions may cause legal liability for you, our Users or for 
                Work4Sale. Once suspended or terminated, you MAY NOT continue to use the Work4Sale 
                service under a different account or reregister under a new account. If you 
                attempt to use the Work4Sale service under a different account, we reserve the right 
                to reclaim available funds in that account and/or use an available payment 
                method to pay for any amounts outstanding. In addition, violations of this 
                Agreement may be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and may result in 
                additional penalties and sanctions. If a User engages in actions or activities 
                which circumvent the Work4Sale Platform or otherwise reduces fees owed Work4Sale under 
                this Agreement, that User will be liable to Work4Sale for the fees due and may be 
                subject to additional sanctions including, but not limited to, suspension or 
                termination of your Work4Sale account. Work4Sale reserves the right to terminate any 
                User for any reason, at its sole discretion and to refuse to provide 
                registration and membership to you in the future. We will notify you if we 
                cancel your membership, unless in our judgment giving notice would cause a risk 
                of further violation or damages. However, we will notify you that your account 
                will be canceled if the law requires such notification. When your membership is 
                canceled, you may no longer have access to any parts of the Work4Sale Platform, 
                including data, messages, files and other material you keep on Work4Sale. All

                User agrees that all Service Contracts between User and any Employer or 
                Contractor regarding particular Contracts shall: (i) include but not be limited 
                to substantially the same material terms and conditions provided in Sections 3.1 
                through 3.10 below (<strong><em>&quot;Standard Terms&quot;</em></strong>); (ii) name Work4Sale 
                as an express third party beneficiary under the Service Contract; and (iii) make 
                no representations or warranties or enter into any contracts on behalf of Work4Sale, 
                except as may be otherwise provided for herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
                to the extent that Employer and Contractor agree to terms in their Service 
                Contract materially different than the Standard Terms, nothing in such Service

                Services.</span><br />
                Contractor shall perform Services in a professional and workmanlike manner. 
                Under Fixed-Price Contracts, Contractor shall deliver the agreed-upon Work 
                Product. Under Hourly-Rate Contracts, Contractor shall use reasonable efforts to 
                create the desired Work Product.</div>

                Agency.</span><br />
                Work performed on Hourly-Rate Contracts under a Contractor&#39;s profile must be 
                performed by the Contractor represented. If the Contractor wishes to subcontract 
                with third parties to perform Services on behalf of the Contractor on 
                Hourly-Rate Contracts, the Contractor must do so as an Agency. In the event 
                Contractor establishes him/her/itself through Work4Sale as an Agency, Contractor and 
                Agency agree and acknowledge that Agency&#39;s employees or contract personnel are 
                not employees of Work4Sale or Employer. Agency is solely responsible for all wages, 
                costs, and expenses of Agency&#39;s employees or contract personnel and has the sole 
                and exclusive right to supervise and control them. Neither Employer, nor Work4Sale, 
                will require Agency&#39;s employees or contract personnel to devote full time to 
                performing the Contracts entered into by Contractor and/or Agency as required by 
                this Agreement. Furthermore, both Contractor and Agency acknowledge and agree 
                that neither it, nor any of its employees or agents, shall have any claim under 
                this Agreement for overtime pay, sick leave, holiday or vacation pay, retirement 
                benefits, worker&#39;s compensation benefits, unemployment benefits, or any other 
                employee benefits of any kind from Work4Sale or Employer.</div>

                Employer shall pay Contractor the agreed-upon fees for time spent (under 
                Hourly-Rate Contracts) or delivery of the Work Product (under Fixed-Price 
                Contracts). All amounts paid by Employer shall be paid through the Work4Sale

                Termination of a Service Contract.</span><br />
                Under Hourly-Rate Contracts, either party may terminate the Service Contract at 
                any time for any or no reason. However, the Employer remains obligated to pay 
                for any time the Contractor worked prior to termination.</div>
            <div class="answer" style="margin-bottom: 12px; ">
                For Fixed-Price Contracts, the Employer may terminate at any time but may not 
                recover any payments made to the Contractor unless mutually agreeable. The 
                Contractor may terminate Fixed-Price Contracts at any time if no payment has 
                been made. If a payment has been made on a Fixed Price Contract, the Contractor 
                may terminate only with written agreement from the Employer or after the payment 
                has been refunded.</div>

                Employer Deliverables.</span><br />
                Employer grants Contractor a limited, non-exclusive, revocable (at any time, at 
                Employer&#39;s sole discretion) right to use the Employer Deliverables as necessary 
                for the performance of the Services. Employer reserves all other rights and 
                interest, including, without limitation, all Proprietary Rights, in and to the 
                Employer Deliverables. Upon completion or termination of the Contract, or upon 
                written request by the Employer, Contractor shall immediately return all 
                Employer Deliverables to the Employer and further agrees to purge all copies of 
                Employer Deliverables and Work Product contained in or on Contractor&#39;s premises, 
                systems, or any other equipment otherwise under Contractor&#39;s control. Contractor 
                agrees to provide written certification to the Employer certifying the return or 
                purging of Employer Deliverables within ten (10) days after the receipt of the 
                Employer&#39;s written request to certify.</div>

                Any copyrightable works or works for hire prepared by Contractor in connection 
                with a Fixed-Price Contract for Employer shall be owned by the Contractor until 
                payment has been made by the Employer and accepted by the Contractor. If the 
                Employer pays an amount less than the amount agreed to in the terms of the 
                Contract, the Contractor may refund the amount paid within two (2) weeks of the 
                payment date and retain ownership of the Work Product.</div>
            <div class="answer" style="margin-bottom: 12px; ">
                For Hourly-Rate Contracts, the Employer is considered the author and owner of 
                works created once payment for the period of time in question has been made in 
                full, assuming that all hours worked are properly tracked using the Work4Sale 
                resources. Once payment has been made in accordance with the above, Contractor 
                shall be deemed to have assigned all Proprietary Rights to Work Product to 
                Employer.</div>
            <div class="answer" style="margin-bottom: 12px; ">
                To the extent that under applicable law, Proprietary Rights cannot be assigned, 
                Contractor hereby irrevocably agrees to grant, and hereby grants, to Employer an 
                exclusive (excluding also Contractor), perpetual, irrevocable, unlimited, 
                worldwide, fully paid, and unconditional license to use and commercialize Work 
                Product in any manner now known or in the future discovered. To the extent such 
                license grant is not fully valid, effective or enforceable under applicable law, 
                Contractor hereby irrevocably agrees to grant, and hereby grants, to Employer, 
                such rights as Employer reasonably requests in order to acquire, as close as 
                possible, all rights equivalent to full legal ownership. In order to ensure that 
                Employer will be able to acquire, perfect and use such Proprietary Rights, 
                Contractor will: (i) transfer possession, ownership, and title to media, models, 
                and other tangible objects containing Work Product to Employer; (ii) sign any 
                documents at Employer’s request to assist Employer in the documentation, 
                perfection and enforcement of its rights; and (iii) provide Employer with 
                support and reasonable access to information for recording, perfecting, 
                securing, defending, and enforcing such Proprietary Rights. Contractor also 
                irrevocably authorizes Employer to act and sign on Contractor’s behalf and take 
                any necessary steps in order to perfect Employer’s rights under this Agreement. 
                In case that under applicable law, Contractor retains any rights of paternity, 
                integrity, disclosure and withdrawal and any other rights that may be known as 
                or referred to as &quot;moral rights&quot; (collectively &quot;Moral Rights&quot;) or other 
                inalienable rights to Work Product or Confidential Information under this 
                Agreement, Contractor irrevocably agrees to waive, and hereby waives, all such 
                rights, or, to the extent Contractor cannot waive such rights, Contractor agrees 
                not to exercise such rights, until Contractor has provided prior written notice 
                to Employer and then only in accordance with any reasonable instructions that 
                Employer issues in the interest of protecting its rights. Contractor agrees to 
                assist Employer in every proper way to obtain and enforce the Proprietary Rights 
                and other legal protections for the Work Product in any and all countries. 
                Contractor will sign documents that the Employer may reasonably request for use 
                in obtaining and enforcing such protection, including, but not limited to, any 
                assignment deed which the Employer may select at its sole discretion. 
                Contractor’s obligations under this Section 3.6 will continue even after 
                Contractor deregisters from or ceases use of the Work4Sale Platform. Contractor 
                appoints Employer as Contractor’s attorney-in-fact to execute documents on 
                Contractor’s behalf for the purposes set forth in this Section 3.6.</div>

                independent contractors or employees based on IRS and other federal, state and 
                local guidelines. Employer and Contractor further acknowledge and agree that the 
                relationship exists specifically and expressly between Employer and Contractor 
                and that no employment relationship exists between Employer and Work4Sale or 
                Contractor and Work4Sale. This Agreement does not create a partnership or agency 
                relationship between Employer and Contractor. Contractor does not have authority 
                to enter into written or oral — whether implied or express — contracts on behalf 
                of Employer.</div>

                Contractor recognizes, acknowledges and agrees that he/she/it is not an employee 
                of Work4Sale and does not receive any training from Work4Sale. Contractor acknowledges 
                that Work4Sale does not, in any way, supervise, direct, or control Contractor&#39;s work 
                or Services performed in any manner. Work4Sale does not set Contractor&#39;s work hours

                Work4Sale will not deduct any amount for withholding, unemployment, Social Security,

                will be solely responsible for all tax returns and payments required to be filed

                For Contracts classified as employer-employee relationships, Employer will

                becomes an hourly employee of Work4Sale&#39;s staffing affiliate and Contractor and 
                Employer must enter into an Work4Sale User Agreement for Payrolling Program. If 
                Employer elects to not utilize this program, Employer and Contractor shall be 
                solely responsible for all obligations for tax withholding, the payment of taxes

                Work4Sale shall have no responsibility for determining the necessity of or for 
                issuing any formal invoices, or for determining, remitting, or withholding any 
                taxes applicable to Contractor Fees. Instead, Contractor shall be solely 
                responsible for determining whether it is required by applicable law to issue 
                any formal invoices for the Contractor Fees and for issuing any invoices so 
                required. Contractor shall also be solely responsible for: (a) determining 
                whether Contractor or Work4Sale is required by applicable law to remit to the 
                appropriate authorities any value added tax or any other taxes or similar 
                charges applicable to the Contractor Fees, and remitting any such taxes or 
                charges to the appropriate authorities on behalf of itself or Work4Sale, as 
                appropriate; and (b) determining whether Work4Sale is required by applicable law to 
                withhold any amount of the Contractor Fees, notifying Work4Sale of any such 
                requirement and indemnifying Work4Sale (either by permitting Work4Sale to offset the 
                relevant amount against a future payment of Contractor Fees or by refunding to 
                Work4Sale the relevant amount, at Work4Sale’s sole discretion) for any requirement to 
                pay any withholding amount to the appropriate authorities. Work4Sale shall have the 
                right, but not the obligation, to audit and monitor Contractor’s compliance with 
                applicable tax laws as required by this Section 5.1. Further, in the event of an 
                audit of Work4Sale, Contractor agrees to promptly cooperate with Work4Sale and provide 
                copies of Contractor’s state and federal income tax returns, and other documents 
                as may be reasonably requested for purposes of such audit.</div>

                Invoices to Employer.</span><br />
                For Hourly-Rate Contracts, Employer will be invoiced for hourly Contractor Fees 
                on a weekly basis. For bonuses, milestone payments and Fixed-Price payments, 
                Employer is billed immediately. If Employer believes an Hourly-Rate Contract 
                charge to be incorrect, Employer shall notify Work4Sale within the time period set 
                forth in the Billing and Payments Policy, in which case Work4Sale will promptly 
                investigate the Time Log to determine, in its sole discretion, whether an 
                adjustment is appropriate. Work4Sale&#39;s determination shall be final. If Employer 
                does not notify Work4Sale within this time set forth in the Billing and Payments 
                Policy, the charge automatically becomes final and Employer cannot appeal it.</div>

                nature of the number of hours recorded in the Time Logs shall be resolved

                Payment Guarantee.</span><br />
                Work4Sale will guarantee payment to Contractors working on Hourly-Rate Contracts 
                where the Employer has a verified payment method, the time represented is 
                captured online using the Work4Sale Team software, the work performed and captured 
                pertains directly to the Contract billed, and each Time Log is annotated with 
                appropriate work memos describing the work performed. Determination of whether 
                these criteria have been met is at the sole discretion of Work4Sale. The Payment 
                Guarantee will not apply to Contractors or Contracts in violation of this 
                Agreement, where the Contractor is aware of or complicit in another User’s 
                violation of this Agreement, or where there is any other involvement in 
                fraudulent activities or abuse of this Payment Guarantee.</div>

                Freelancer Contractor Services Agreement, and/or Affiliate Services Agreement

                Previous Agreements except that User remains entitled to any fees for Services

                Previous Agreements and which Work4Sale has not remitted as of the Transition Date. 
                Work4Sale remains entitled to payment on invoices for Contracts commenced under 
                Previous Agreements with User. User&#39;s continued use of the Work4Sale Platform as an

                Failure by any Employer to terminate any Contract commenced under a Previous 
                Agreement prior to the Transition Date (&quot;Ongoing Contract&quot;) constitutes an offer 
                to the Contractor under such Ongoing Contract to continue the Ongoing Contract 
                under a Service Contract with the terms and conditions set forth in Section 3 
                (Service Contract Terms Between Employer and Contractor) or any other terms 
                expressly agreed to by the Employer and the Contractor through the Work4Sale 
                Platform (&quot;Offer to Continue&quot;). A Contractor’s continuation of work on any 
                Ongoing Contract on or after the Transition Date constitutes the Contractor’s 
                acceptance of the Employer’s Offer to Continue such Ongoing Contract.</div>

                confidentiality agreement, work for hire agreement, assignment of rights, etc.). 
                The terms and conditions of this Agreement, however, will govern and supersede 
                any term or condition in a side agreement that purports to expand Work4Sale&#39;s

                Informal Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.</span><br />
                Work4Sale and User hereby agree that any Claims shall first be settled through the 
                Work4Sale dispute resolution program. Claims that the parties cannot resolve 
                informally and where the amount in controversy is less than USD$25,000, the 
                parties agree to resolve the Claims in a cost-effective manner through binding 
                non-appearance-based arbitration conducted by a single arbitrator. If a party 
                elects arbitration, that party will initiate the arbitration through an 
                established alternative dispute resolution (ADR) provider mutually agreed upon 
                by the parties or the American Arbitration Association (AAA) if no other service 
                is agreed upon. The arbitrator shall be selected from a list of no less than 
                five names through alternative strikes. Unless the parties mutually agree 
                otherwise, the ADR provider and the parties will proceed as follows:</div>

                Disputes over $25,000 that do not involve Work4Sale may be resolved in whatever 
                forum the parties deem appropriate. The California state courts of San Mateo 
                County (or, if there is exclusive federal jurisdiction, the United States 
                District Court for the Northern District of California) will have jurisdiction 
                and venue over any Claims where Work4Sale is a party and the amount in controversy 
                exceeds $25,000; each party hereby irrevocably consents to the personal 
                jurisdiction and venue of these courts. This Agreement does not prevent the
