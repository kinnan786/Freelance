                    Exhedra systems can and are routinely monitored by staff for legal and terms of 
                    service violations. Exhedra uses the best of its ability, utilizing state of the 
                    art techniques to protect all privacy related data from external and 
                    unauthorized party access. However no security system is 100% full-proof, so 
                    should sensitive data be compromised, Exhedra will alert the affected parties 
                    immediately via email addresses as registered on the site. Due to the nature of 
                    security, Exhedra will not be held liable for any such security compromise, or 
                    any resulting loss or action resulting from such a compromise.</font></font></font></font></font></font></td>
